*1. What question are you trying to answer?*

"Is there credible evidence of disinformation campaigns on Twitter related to the Ukraine war, and if so, at the magnitude of which only a state actor (i.e. Russia) would be able to organize?

*2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.*

To me, this question is worth answering because I have followed this conflict and believe that it is a critical time for decision-making when it comes to US foreign policy related to the war. The instability and recklessness of our current leader, along with his extremely concerning tendencies to praise authoritarian foreign leaders like Vladimir Putin, motivate me to find some kind of convincing evidence of the criminal, anti-democratic activities of the Kremlin's social media propaganda machine. I hope to show this evidence to friends and family that may not grasp just how effective these tactics can be when attempting to manipulate the voting public.

*3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?*

**Hypothesis:** 

There is credible evidence on Twitter of coordinated disinformation campaigns linked to the Ukraine war, and the scale and organizational complexity of these campaigns strongly suggest involvement by state actorsâ€”most likely the Kremlin.

**Rationale:**

* Historical precedents: Prior studies on disinformation have documented similar large-scale, coordinated campaigns during other geopolitical conflicts, often with patterns unique to state-sponsored operations. The FBI has uncovered multiple instances of Russian election interference in the past, and there is no reason to believe they would stop,

* Geopolitical context: Given the strategic interests of Russia in the region and documented evidence of state-run information operations in the past, it is plausible that the magnitude of coordination necessary for such a campaign is only achievable by a well-resourced state actor.

* Twitter's history of bots: Many studies have estimated that over 20% of global daily users on Twitter are bots, meaning that there is little being done to combat large-scale operations on the site.

*4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question?*
